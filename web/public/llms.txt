# AI DevKit

> AI DevKit is an open-source CLI toolkit that brings structure and consistency to AI-assisted software development. It works alongside AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, and others.

AI DevKit solves common problems with AI-assisted development: context loss between sessions, ad hoc workflows, repeated instructions, and siloed knowledge. It provides structured workflows, long-term memory, a community-driven skills system, and multi-agent support.

## Core Features

- **Structured Development Workflows**: Phase-based guidance through requirements, design, planning, implementation, testing, and code review
- **Long-Term Memory**: 100% local SQLite-based knowledge storage for coding standards, patterns, and decisions across sessions
- **Skills System**: Community-driven plugins that teach AI new capabilities and domain-specific patterns
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Works with 11+ AI coding environments including Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, Windsurf, and more
