# Vision

AI DevKit exists to bridge the gap between AI-assisted development and structured software engineering practices.

## Our Purpose

We believe that AI coding assistants are most powerful when they work within a well-defined engineering framework where documentation is clear, plans are systematic, and architecture is intentional.

AI DevKit provides the scaffolding for that structure. It helps engineers reduce the back-and-forth of prompting, keep context in sync, and share memory between themselves and their AI tools.

Our goal is simple:
To make working with AI feel as natural and reliable as working with your favorite teammate, the one who already knows your project, your style, and your standards.

## What We're Building

A toolkit that enables developers to:

- **Document thoroughly** - Capture requirements, design decisions, and implementation notes in a consistent format
- **Plan systematically** - Break down complex features into manageable tasks with clear dependencies
- **Collaborate effectively** - Share context with AI assistants and human teammates through well-organized documentation
- **Maintain quality** - Ensure testing coverage and code review processes are baked into the workflow

## Our Principles

1. **Documentation-first development** - Start with clear requirements before writing code
2. **Phase-based workflow** - Move through requirements, design, planning, implementation, and testing in a structured way
3. **AI-friendly context** - Organize project knowledge so AI assistants can provide better assistance
4. **Low friction** - Make it easy to follow best practices without heavy tooling overhead

## Looking Forward

We envision a future where structured development practices are the default, not the exception. Where every feature starts with clear requirements and ends with comprehensive tests. Where AI assistants amplify human capabilities by working within well-defined frameworks.

AI DevKit is our contribution to that future.
