Streamline your workflow by automatically configuring agent-specific hooks, such as those for Claude Code or Cursor. This feature will enable you to define "chain-reactions"—like automatically triggering a `/code-review` command immediately after an implementation step is completed—ensuring quality checks happen without you needing to remember to run them manually.
