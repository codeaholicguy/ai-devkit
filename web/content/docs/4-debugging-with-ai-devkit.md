## Use `/debug` for Systematic Problem Solving

When issues arise, the `/debug` command provides a structured 7-step methodology to identify, analyze, and resolve problems systematically.

```bash
# In Cursor or Claude Code
/debug
```

### The 7-Step Debugging Process

**1. Gather Context**
- Understand what's happening vs. what should happen
- Identify the scope and impact of the issue
- Collect error messages, logs, and symptoms

**2. Clarify Expectations**
- Confirm requirements and acceptance criteria
- Define success metrics for the fix
- Identify relevant documentation or tickets

**3. Reproduce & Isolate**
- Create reliable reproduction steps
- Isolate the problem to specific components
- Identify environment-specific factors

**4. Analyze Causes**
- Brainstorm potential root causes
- Gather supporting evidence (logs, metrics, traces)
- Identify gaps in understanding

**5. Surface Options**
- Present multiple resolution approaches
- Evaluate pros, cons, and risks for each option
- Consider implementation complexity and timeline

**6. Confirm Path**
- Select the best resolution approach
- Define success criteria and validation steps
- Plan required approvals and coordination

**7. Track Actions**
- Document specific tasks and owners
- Set timelines and follow-up actions
- Plan monitoring and communication
