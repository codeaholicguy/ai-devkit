## Use `/capture-knowledge` for Code Analysis

When working with existing codebases, the `/capture-knowledge` command helps you understand complex systems by analyzing code from any entry point and generating comprehensive documentation with visual diagrams.

```bash
# In Cursor
/capture-knowledge <entry-point> [options]

# In Claude Code  
Use the capture-knowledge command to analyze <entry-point>
```

### Entry Point Types

**Files:**
```bash
/capture-knowledge src/api/users.ts
```
Analyzes a specific file and its dependencies.

**Folders:**
```bash
/capture-knowledge src/services/
```
Analyzes an entire module or directory structure.

**Functions:**
```bash
/capture-knowledge calculateTotalPrice
```
Analyzes a specific function and its call chain.

**API Endpoints:**
```bash
/capture-knowledge POST:/api/users
```
Analyzes complete API request/response flow.
