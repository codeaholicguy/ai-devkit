description: Review the requirements documentation for a feature to ensure completeness and alignment with project standards.
---

Please review `docs/ai/requirements/feature-{name}.md` and the project-level template `docs/ai/requirements/README.md` to ensure structure and content alignment. Summarize:

## Memory (use when helpful)
- If you need clarification or project conventions, query `memory.searchKnowledge` with a brief task description, tags, and scope.
- If I ask to save reusable guidance, run `/remember` (or call `memory.storeKnowledge`).
- If MCP tools are unavailable, use `ai-devkit memory search` or `ai-devkit memory store`.

- Core problem statement and affected users
- Goals, non-goals, and success criteria
- Primary user stories & critical flows
- Constraints, assumptions, open questions
- Any missing sections or deviations from the template

Identify gaps or contradictions and suggest clarifications.
