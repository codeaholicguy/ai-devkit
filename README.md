## Customizing Templates

All templates are plain Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. You can customize them to fit your project's needs:

```markdown
---
phase: requirements
title: Requirements & Problem Understanding
description: Clarify the problem space, gather requirements, and define success criteria
---

# Your custom content here
```

Templates are designed to provide structure while remaining concise and AI-friendly.

## Workflow Examples

### Initial Project Setup

1. **Initialize your project:**
   ```bash
   ai-devkit init
   ```

2. **Start with requirements:**
   - Fill out `docs/ai/requirements/README.md`
   - Use your AI assistant to help clarify and document requirements

3. **Design your system:**
   - Complete `docs/ai/design/README.md` and feature-specific files
   - Include mermaid diagrams for architecture, component interactions, and data flow
   - Reference requirements when making design decisions

4. **Plan your work:**
   - Break down tasks in `docs/ai/planning/README.md`
   - Estimate and prioritize

5. **Implement with guidance:**
   - Follow patterns in `docs/ai/implementation/README.md`
   - Keep implementation notes updated

6. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Use `docs/ai/testing/README.md` as your testing guide
   - Document test cases and results

7. **Deploy confidently:**
   - Follow deployment procedures in `docs/ai/deployment/README.md`

8. **Monitor and iterate:**
   - Set up monitoring per `docs/ai/monitoring/README.md`

### Adding a New Feature

**Use the `/new-requirement` command for a guided workflow:**

1. **In Cursor or Claude Code**, type `/new-requirement`
2. The AI will guide you through:
   - 📋 Capturing requirement details
   - 🔍 Creating feature-specific documentation
   - 📐 Designing the solution
   - 📅 Planning tasks and breaking down work
   - 💻 Implementation (task by task)
   - ✅ Testing and verification
   - 🔀 Git commits and PR/MR creation

**Review and refine your documentation:**
- After drafting requirements, run `/review-requirements` to validate completeness
- After drafting design, run `/review-design` to ensure architecture clarity and mermaid diagrams

**Execute your plan:**
- Run `/execute-plan` to step through tasks interactively:
  - Reads `docs/ai/planning/feature-{name}.md`
  - Presents tasks in order with context
  - Captures status/notes for each task
  - Prompts you to update documentation as you progress

**Before pushing your code:**
- Run `/code-review` to perform a structured local review:
  - Checks alignment with design docs
  - Spots logic/security/performance issues
  - Highlights redundant code and missing tests
  - Suggests documentation updates

**Generate comprehensive tests:**
- Run `/writing-test` to create unit and integration tests targeting 100% coverage

This workflow creates feature-specific files:
- `docs/ai/requirements/feature-{name}.md`
- `docs/ai/design/feature-{name}.md`
- `docs/ai/planning/feature-{name}.md`
- `docs/ai/implementation/feature-{name}.md`
- `docs/ai/testing/feature-{name}.md`

### Understanding Existing Code

**Use the `/capture-knowledge` command to analyze and document code:**

The `capture-knowledge` command helps you understand how existing code works by analyzing it from any entry point and generating comprehensive documentation with visual diagrams.

**In Cursor:**
```
/capture-knowledge <entry-point> [options]
```

**In Claude Code:**
```
Use the capture-knowledge command to analyze <entry-point>
```

**Entry Point Types:**
- **File**: `/capture-knowledge src/api/users.ts` - Analyzes a specific file
- **Folder**: `/capture-knowledge src/services/` - Analyzes an entire module
- **Function**: `/capture-knowledge calculateTotalPrice` - Analyzes a specific function
- **API Endpoint**: `/capture-knowledge POST:/api/users` - Analyzes an API endpoint flow

**Options:**
- `--depth <n>` - Control recursion depth (default: 3)
- `--save` - Save output to `docs/ai/knowledge/`
- `--diagram-only` - Generate only diagrams

**What You Get:**
- 📖 **Detailed Explanation**: Natural language description of how the code works
- 🔍 **Implementation Details**: Key components, logic flow, and design patterns
- 🔗 **Recursive Dependency Analysis**: Automatically traces and explains all dependencies
- 📊 **Mermaid Diagrams**: Visual flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and architecture diagrams
- 💡 **Insights**: Performance considerations, security notes, potential improvements

**Example Outputs:**

For functions, you get:
- Flowchart showing execution path
- Parameter and return value documentation
- Called functions and their purposes
- Error handling strategy

For API endpoints, you get:
- Sequence diagram showing request flow
- Validation and authentication steps
- Database operations
- Response format

For modules/folders, you get:
- Architecture diagram showing component relationships
- Overview of each file's purpose
- Module boundaries and dependencies

**Use Cases:**
- 🎯 Onboarding new developers to understand the codebase
- 📚 Generating documentation for complex systems
- 🔍 Debugging by understanding complete execution flow
- 🏗️ Refactoring with full context of dependencies
- 📖 Creating knowledge base entries

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Understand a payment function
/capture-knowledge processPayment --depth 4

# Document an entire authentication module
/capture-knowledge src/auth/ --save

# Analyze an API endpoint
/capture-knowledge POST:/api/checkout

# Get just the diagrams for a complex function
/capture-knowledge handleOrderProcessing --diagram-only
```

The analysis is saved to `docs/ai/knowledge/` and can be versioned alongside your code.

## Use Cases

- **New Projects**: Scaffold complete development documentation
- **Existing Projects**: Add structured documentation gradually
- **Team Collaboration**: Share common development practices
- **AI Pair Programming**: Provide context for AI assistants
- **Knowledge Management**: Document decisions and patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Keep templates updated**: As your project evolves, update phase documentation
2. **Reference across phases**: Link requirements to design, design to implementation
3. **Use with AI assistants**: Templates are designed to work well with AI code assistants
4. **Customize for your needs**: Templates are starting points, not rigid requirements
5. **Track decisions**: Document architectural decisions and their rationale

## Configuration File

The `.ai-devkit.json` file tracks your setup:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "environment": "cursor",
  "initializedPhases": ["requirements", "design", "planning"],
  "createdAt": "2025-10-14T...",
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-14T..."
}
```

## Development

To work on ai-devkit itself:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-devkit

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev init

# Build
npm run build

# Test locally
npm link
ai-devkit init
```

> **Note:** `ai-devkit init` now ensures the current directory is a git repository. If git is available and the repo isn't initialized, it will run `git init` automatically.
