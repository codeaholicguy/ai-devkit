# Claude Code Workspace Configuration

## Project Overview
This project uses ai-devkit for structured AI-assisted software development. All phase documentation is maintained in the `docs/ai/` directory.

## Documentation Structure
- `docs/ai/requirements/` - Problem understanding and requirements
- `docs/ai/design/` - System architecture and design decisions
- `docs/ai/planning/` - Task breakdown and project planning
- `docs/ai/implementation/` - Implementation guides and notes
- `docs/ai/testing/` - Testing strategy and test cases
- `docs/ai/deployment/` - Deployment and infrastructure docs
- `docs/ai/monitoring/` - Monitoring and observability setup

## Working with Phase Documentation

### Before Starting New Work
1. Review relevant phase documentation to understand context
2. Check requirements and design docs for constraints and decisions
3. Consult planning doc for task priorities and dependencies

### During Implementation
- Keep implementation notes updated in `docs/ai/implementation/`
- Document significant decisions and their rationale
- Update design docs if architecture changes

### Code Review Checklist
- Does the code align with documented requirements?
- Does it follow the architectural patterns in design docs?
- Are tests written according to the testing strategy?
- Is new functionality documented?

## AI Assistance Best Practices
- Reference phase docs when asking for implementation help
- Update documentation as the project evolves
- Use structured phases to break down complex problems
- Keep requirements and design in sync with implementation

## Key Commands
When working on this project, you can reference phase documentation to:
- Understand project requirements and goals
- Review architectural decisions
- Check implementation guidelines
- Verify testing approaches
- Plan deployment strategies
