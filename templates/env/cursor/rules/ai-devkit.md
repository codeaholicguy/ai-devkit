# AI DevKit Rules

## Project Context
This project uses ai-devkit for structured AI-assisted development. Phase documentation is located in `docs/ai/`.

## Code Style & Standards
- Follow the project's established code style and conventions
- Write clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious decisions

## Development Workflow
- Review phase documentation in `docs/ai/` before implementing features
- Keep requirements, design, and implementation docs updated as the project evolves
- Reference the planning doc for task breakdown and priorities

## AI Interaction Guidelines
- When implementing features, first check relevant phase documentation
- For new features, start with requirements clarification
- Update phase docs when significant changes or decisions are made

## Testing & Quality
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Follow the testing strategy defined in `docs/ai/testing/`
- Ensure code passes all tests before considering it complete

## Documentation
- Update phase documentation when requirements or design changes
- Keep inline code comments focused and relevant
- Document architectural decisions and their rationale
