# Phase 2: Review Requirements

Review `docs/ai/requirements/feature-{name}.md` against the template `docs/ai/requirements/README.md` to ensure structure and content alignment.

## What to Review

1. **Core problem statement** — Is it clear? Does it identify affected users?
2. **Goals and non-goals** — Are they specific and measurable?
3. **Success criteria** — Are they testable and unambiguous?
4. **User stories and critical flows** — Do they cover primary and edge-case scenarios?
5. **Constraints and assumptions** — Are they realistic and documented?
6. **Open questions** — Are there unresolved items that block design or implementation?
7. **Template compliance** — Are any sections missing or deviating from the template?

## Output

Summarize:
- Core problem statement and affected users
- Goals, non-goals, and success criteria
- Primary user stories and critical flows
- Constraints, assumptions, open questions
- Missing sections or deviations from template
- Gaps, contradictions, or items needing clarification

Provide specific, actionable suggestions for each gap found.
