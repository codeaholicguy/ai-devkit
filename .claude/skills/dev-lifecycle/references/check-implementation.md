# Phase 5: Check Implementation

Compare current implementation with design and requirements docs to ensure alignment.

## Step 1: Gather Context

Ask for:
- Feature/branch description
- List of modified files
- Relevant design doc(s) (feature-specific and/or project-level)
- Known constraints or assumptions

## Step 2: Summarize Design

For each design doc:
- Summarize key architectural decisions and constraints
- Highlight components, interfaces, and data flows that must be respected

## Step 3: File-by-File Comparison

For each modified file:
- Confirm implementation matches design intent
- Note deviations or missing pieces
- Flag logic gaps, edge cases, or security issues
- Suggest simplifications or refactors
- Identify missing tests or documentation updates

## Step 4: Output

Summarize findings with:
- Alignment status per component
- Deviations from design (with severity)
- Missing pieces or incomplete implementations
- Security or performance concerns
- Recommended next steps (fixes, tests, doc updates)
