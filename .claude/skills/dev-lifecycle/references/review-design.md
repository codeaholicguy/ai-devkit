# Phase 3: Review Design

Review `docs/ai/design/feature-{name}.md` (and the project-level README if relevant) for completeness and accuracy.

## What to Review

1. **Architecture overview** — Is a mermaid diagram present and accurate?
2. **Key components** — Are responsibilities clearly defined?
3. **Technology choices** — Is the rationale documented?
4. **Data models and relationships** — Are schemas complete?
5. **API/interface contracts** — Are inputs, outputs, and auth specified?
6. **Design decisions and trade-offs** — Are alternatives considered?
7. **Non-functional requirements** — Performance, security, scalability addressed?

## Output

Summarize:
- Architecture overview with diagram assessment
- Key components and their responsibilities
- Technology choices and rationale
- Data models and relationships
- API/interface contracts (inputs, outputs, auth)
- Major design decisions and trade-offs
- Non-functional requirements that must be preserved

Highlight inconsistencies, missing sections, or diagrams that need updates. Provide actionable recommendations.
